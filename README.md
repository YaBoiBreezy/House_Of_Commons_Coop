# House_Of_Commons_Coop
Code from working at the House of Commons:

## MMS_prototype
Proposal for new control scheme for video player. Made full suite of video player controls, fully functional, mobile version of controls, resize handlers, and used videojs to handle unsupported streaming formats

## Ourcommons
Similar to MMS_prototype, but different website, more view options (miniplayer, moveable lightbox, minimized)

## Forced Alignment
Backend: Using forced alignment to line up audio recording in english or french with a transcript. Stored all data in JSON, should have used SQL but didn't learn SQL until year 3
Frontend: Advanced word search to find parts of transcript, then pull up the video recording at that point
